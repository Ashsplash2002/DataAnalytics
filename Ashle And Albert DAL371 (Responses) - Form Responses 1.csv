When I asked Mr Welgemoed about this, he mentioned that the reason I’m online is because the Business Intelligence stream has lower demand in comparison to the Software Engineering stream and they have more to students to accommodate, hence, they have physical classes for the rest of the year, whereas, we as BI students don’t as we are not that many, 

So my suggestion would be to still pay attention to physical students like us who took BI and make some arrangements for us to accommodate us in a physical class as well. "
